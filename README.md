# Visualeyes

I'm not a very visual person, and I'm learning algorithms and data structures. So this project is to help both of those things...

I plan to build this out to visualise a handful of different [sorting algos](https://github.com/tomdaniels/playground/tree/master/algo/sort) i've been playing with, and rewrite the [pathfinding & maze generating visualiser](https://pathfinder-tau.vercel.app/) with better principles & TS.
